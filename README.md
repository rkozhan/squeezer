# Squeezer - URL Shortener (In Development)

This application is currently under active development. It serves as a URL shortener, allowing users to shorten long URLs and track them.

## Live version
You can view the live version of the application hosted on Render.com [here](https://squeezer.onrender.com/). Please note that the initial loading time may be longer than usual as the service on Render.com may be in a sleep mode and needs to wake up.

### Test Credentials
login:
name@test.com
password:
Abc123$

### Note on Short URLs
Since this is a development and testing version hosted on Render, the shortened URLs generated by the service may appear longer than what you'd expect on a fully deployed project. For example, shortened URLs on Render might look like:
squeezer.onrender.com/r/abc123

On a real production environment, the URLs will be more concise, something like:
sqzr.co/abc123 or
sqzr.co/r/abc123

## Development Status
This project is still in the early stages of development. Expect frequent updates and changes.

## Deployment Information
The live version of this app is deployed using Render.com, the application might enter a sleep mode when not in use, which results in longer load times for the first request.
